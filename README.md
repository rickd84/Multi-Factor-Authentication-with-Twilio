# Multi-Factor-Authentication-with-Twilio
Using Twilio SMS Web API and Python to send a one time verification code via text message

This project is about multi-factor authentication. This project uses two different factors to authenticate a
user who has forgotten their password. The first factor used will be a security question the user
already knows the answer to. The second factor will be a code obtained from a text
message. Once the user correctly answers the security question, and correctly enters the code
received from a text message, they will be able to login and change their password.
The auth_token has been redacted for security purposes.
